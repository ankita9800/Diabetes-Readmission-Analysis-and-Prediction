## Patient-Readmission-for-Diabetes

The goal of the project is to develop a machine-learning model that accurately predicts whether a patient with diabetes will be readmitted to the hospital after their initial discharge. This prediction is crucial for healthcare providers as readmission of diabetic patients can lead to increased costs, higher mortality rates, and reduced quality of life. By developing an accurate predictive model, healthcare providers can proactively identify patients at higher risk of readmission and take appropriate measures to prevent it.

The project begins with exploratory data analysis of the "Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008" dataset, which contains 100,000 instances and 50 attributes. The dataset includes a mix of numerical and categorical data types, with the target variable indicating whether a patient was readmitted to the hospital after discharge. Other important features in the dataset include demographic information (such as race, gender, age, and weight) and medical information (such as diagnosis codes, prescribed medications, and lab procedures).

After exploring the dataset, the project focuses on feature engineering to select the most relevant features for building the predictive model. Various supervised learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks, are implemented to train the predictive models. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, providing a comprehensive assessment of their predictive capabilities.
